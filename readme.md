This project aims to present a complete implementation of Habiticas' the web api, which takes care of the entire resource management independently. An attempt is made to focus on a user-friendly interface on the one hand, and on the other hand to provide an implementation that is as server-friendly as possible, without developers, in particular for larger projects, having to worry about it.

This package is in its early stages of development and is not yet ready for use.
